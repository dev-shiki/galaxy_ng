Okay, I need to write comprehensive pytest tests for the Galaxy NG's social/__init__.py module. Let me start by understanding the code structure and the functions involved.

First, the module defines a class GalaxyNGOAuth2 which extends GithubOAuth2. The main methods here are do_auth, handle_v3_namespace, get_github_access_token, get_github_user, auth_complete, and some helper functions like validate_namespace_name, transform_namespace_name, etc. There's also a decorator @logged which wraps functions with logging.

The tests need to cover all these methods, ensuring that each path is tested. Since this is Django code, I'll use pytest-django fixtures and mock external dependencies like database queries and HTTP requests.

Starting with the environment setup. The user specified to include the setup at the top. I'll make sure to include the necessary imports and setup code as per the instructions.

Next, I'll need to mock external dependencies. For example, the get_github_access_token and get_github_user methods make HTTP requests. I should mock the requests.post and requests.get calls. Also, the database operations (like Namespace.objects.get_or_create) should be mocked to avoid hitting the real database.

The handle_v3_namespace method has several branches. I need to test different scenarios: when the namespace exists and the user is an owner, when it exists but they aren't, when it doesn't exist, and edge cases like invalid names. The validate_namespace_name function has specific regex checks, so I should test valid and invalid names.

The auth_complete method calls get_github_access_token and do_auth. I'll need to mock the code retrieval and the subsequent steps.

I should also consider error conditions. For instance, if the GitHub API returns an error when fetching the user, or if the access token request fails. These should be tested with appropriate mocks.

Fixtures will help set up common objects. Maybe a fixture for the GalaxyNGOAuth2 instance, mocked strategy, request, and user objects. Also, fixtures for mock objects like Namespace and LegacyNamespace.

Let me outline the test cases:

1. Test get_github_access_token with successful response.
2. Test get_github_access_token with error response (raises exception?).
3. Test get_github_user with valid response.
4. Test get_github_user with invalid response (like 404).
5. Test do_auth with valid data, creating new namespace and legacy namespace.
6. Test do_auth when namespace exists and user is owner.
7. Test do_auth when namespace exists but user isn't owner, so creates a new name.
8. Test handle_v3_namespace with existing namespace and user is owner.
9. Test handle_v3_namespace with existing namespace but not owner, leading to new name.
10. Test handle_v3_namespace when name is invalid, so it doesn't create.
11. Test validate_namespace_name with valid and invalid names.
12. Test transform_namespace_name converts correctly.
13. Test auth_complete with valid code flow.
14. Test auth_complete with invalid code (maybe code not present in request).
15. Test _ensure_legacynamespace creates and binds correctly.

I need to mock the social_core's strategy and other dependencies. For example, the strategy's session_get and authenticate methods. Also, the rbac functions like get_v3_namespace_owners and add_user_to_v3_namespace.

Each test should use pytest fixtures to set up mocks. For example, a fixture for the backend instance with mocked methods.

Wait, the GalaxyNGOAuth2 is a class, so in tests, I can create an instance and mock its methods. But since some methods are decorated with @logged, I need to ensure that the mocks work with the decorator.

Also, the do_auth method calls get_github_user, which is mocked. So in tests for do_auth, I can set up the mock to return a specific user data.

Edge cases for handle_v3_namespace: when the generated namespace name is already taken, so the loop in generate_available_namespace_name increments until it finds an available name. Need to test that.

Another edge case: when the user has existing namespaces but none match the desired name, so it creates a new one with a suffix.

Testing the validate_namespace_name with names like '__test', starting with underscore, too short, etc.

For the _ensure_namespace method, test when the namespace is created vs already exists, and that the user is added as an owner.

I should also mock the transaction.atomic() context managers, but since they're just context managers, maybe just patch them as no-ops.

Now, structuring the test file. The user provided a template, so I'll follow that.

First, the setup code as specified. Then imports from the module under test, like the GalaxyNGOAuth2 class, and other dependencies like Namespace, LegacyNamespace, rbac functions, etc.

Then fixtures. Maybe a fixture for the backend instance with mocked attributes. For example:

@pytest.fixture
def backend():
    backend = GalaxyNGOAuth2()
    backend.strategy = mock.Mock()
    backend.name = 'github'
    return backend

But need to set up more attributes like settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY, etc. Maybe a fixture for settings.

Wait, the get_github_access_token uses settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL, KEY, SECRET. So in tests, those settings should be mocked. Perhaps using pytest-django's override_settings.

Alternatively, in the fixture, mock the settings attributes. But using override_settings might be better.

Hmm, perhaps a fixture that patches the settings:

@pytest.fixture
def mock_github_settings(settings):
    settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://api.github.com'
    settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com'
    settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY = 'test_key'
    settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET = 'test_secret'

Then, in tests that need these settings, use this fixture.

Also, for the requests.post and get, use mock.patch to replace requests with a mock.

Now, writing the tests step by step.

Starting with the get_github_access_token test:

def test_get_github_access_token_success(backend, mock_github_settings, requests_mock):
    code = 'test_code'
    expected_token = 'access_token_123'
    requests_mock.post(
        f"{settings.SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL}/login/oauth/access_token",
        json={'access_token': expected_token}
    )
    result = backend.get_github_access_token(code)
    assert result == expected_token

Another test for error
