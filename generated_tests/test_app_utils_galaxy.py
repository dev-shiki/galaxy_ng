Okay, I need to write comprehensive pytest tests for the galaxy.py module in the Galaxy NG project. Let me start by understanding the functions in the module and how to test them.

First, the module has several functions like generate_unverified_email, uuid_to_int, int_to_uuid, safe_fetch, paginated_results, find_namespace, get_namespace_owners_details, and others. Each of these functions needs to be tested with appropriate mocks and fixtures.

Starting with generate_unverified_email. This function takes a github_id and returns an email string. The test should check that it correctly appends the domain. Edge cases might include different types of github_id (like integers, strings, maybe empty?), but the function expects a string probably. So I'll test with a sample ID like '123' and ensure the output is '123@GALAXY.GITHUB.UNVERIFIED.COM'.

Next, uuid_to_int and int_to_uuid. These functions convert between UUID strings and integers. Need to test a valid UUID, maybe a known example. For example, a UUID like '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' should convert to 0. Then converting back should give the same UUID. Also, test invalid UUIDs? But the function just replaces hyphens and converts to int, so maybe invalid UUIDs would cause errors. But the function's doc says it's for reversable, so perhaps it's intended for valid UUIDs. So test a valid case and maybe an edge case with all zeros.

Moving to safe_fetch. This function makes a GET request with retries on 5xx errors. Since it uses requests.get, I'll need to mock the requests.get. Test cases: successful response (status <500), multiple retries (like 3 times with 500, then success), and exceeding retries (returning the last response). Also, check that it logs the fetch attempts.

Paginated_results handles pagination. It uses safe_fetch, so mock that. Test scenarios: a single page with no next, multiple pages, and cases where next_link is relative or absolute. Also, test when next_url is None, or when the next_link isn't properly formatted. Maybe a case where the next URL is missing, or returns 404 which breaks the loop.

find_namespace: This function searches for a namespace by name or id. It uses safe_fetch, so mock that. Test cases: finding by name (returns the first result), finding by id (direct URL), and cases where the response has no results (maybe 404?), but the function's code breaks if status is 404. Wait, in the code, after fetching, if the response's status is 404, it would break? Let me check the code. In paginated_results, if the response is 404, it breaks. Wait, in find_namespace, when querying by name, it does a GET and then expects ds['results'][0], which could raise an error if not found. But the code might not handle that. Hmm, but the test should check that when name is provided, it constructs the correct URL and processes the response. Also, test when the name isn't found (maybe the response has empty results?), but the code would crash. Maybe the function should handle that, but perhaps the test should check that it's handled. Alternatively, maybe the test should mock the response to have a result. Also, after getting the namespace info, it fetches owners via get_namespace_owners_details, which also needs to be mocked.

get_namespace_owners_details: This function fetches owners for a namespace. It uses safe_fetch again. Test cases: response with 'results' (old galaxy), or a list (new galaxy). Also, test when next_link is present and when it's not. Maybe a case where next_link is empty, so it stops.

The upstream iterators (upstream_namespace_iterator, upstream_collection_iterator, upstream_role_iterator) are more complex. They involve pagination and multiple API calls. For these, I'll need to mock the safe_fetch and paginated_results. Each iterator is a generator, so tests should check that the yielded items are as expected. For example, test that the namespace iterator yields the correct data when there are multiple pages, and that it stops when the limit is reached. Also, test error conditions like 500 errors causing page increments.

Now, considering all these functions, I need to structure the tests with fixtures. Since these functions rely on external APIs (requests), all those calls should be mocked. Using pytest-mock or the unittest.mock library. Also, since some functions use logging, maybe capture logs to ensure they are called correctly.

The test file should start with the Django setup as specified. Then import the necessary modules, like the functions from galaxy.py, and the required mocks.

Let me outline the test structure:

- Import setup: Django environment, pytest, mock, and the module under test.
- Fixtures: Maybe a mock_requests fixture that patches requests.get, or individual mocks for each function's dependencies.
- Tests for each function:

For generate_unverified_email:
def test_generate_unverified_email():
    assert generate_unverified_email('123') == '123@GALAXY.GITHUB.UNVERIFIED.COM'

For uuid_to_int and int_to_uuid:
def test_uuid_conversion():
    uuid_str = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    num = uuid_to_int(uuid_str)
    assert num == 0
    assert int_to_uuid(num) == uuid_str

    another_uuid = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
    num = uuid_to_int(another_uuid)
    reversed_uuid = int_to_uuid(num)
    assert reversed_uuid == another_uuid

For safe_fetch:
Use mock to patch requests.get. Test scenarios:
- Successful response (status 200)
- Retry on 500, then success
- Exceed retries (return last response)
- Check logging calls.

def test_safe_fetch_success(mocker):
    mock_get = mocker.patch('requests.get')
    mock_response = mocker.Mock()
    mock_response.status_code = 200
    mock_get.return_value = mock_response
    result = safe_fetch('http://test.com')
    assert result == mock_response

def test_safe_fetch_retries(mocker, caplog):
    mock_get = mocker.patch('requests.get')
    responses = [mocker.Mock(status_code=500) for _ in range(4)] + [mocker.Mock(status_code=200)]
    mock_get.side_effect = responses
    result = safe_fetch('http://test.com')
    assert mock_get.call_count == 5
    assert result.status_code == 200
    assert 'ERROR:500 waiting 60s to refetch' in caplog.text

def test_safe_fetch_max_retries(mocker):
    mock_get = mocker.patch('requests.get')
    mock_response = mocker.Mock(status_code=503)
    mock_get.return_value = mock_response
    result = safe_fetch('http://test.com')
    assert result.status_code == 503
    assert mock_get.call_count == 5

For paginated_results:
Mock safe_fetch to return a series of responses with next links. Test that all pages are fetched and results are combined.

def test_paginated_results(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    first_response = mocker.Mock()
    first_response.json.return_value = {'results': [1,2], 'next_link': '/next'}
    second_response = mocker.Mock()
    second_response.json.return_value = {'results': [3], 'next_link': None}
    mock_safe.side_effect = [first_response, second_response]
    results = paginated_results('http://start')
    assert results == [1,2,3]

Also test when next_url is None, or when next_link is a relative path that needs baseurl prepended.

For find_namespace:
Test with name and id cases. Mock safe_fetch to return the appropriate JSON responses. Also test when the name isn't found (maybe returns empty results?), but the code might crash here. So perhaps the test should ensure that when name is provided, it constructs the correct URL and processes the first result.

def test_find_namespace_by_name(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    mock_response = mocker.Mock()
    mock_response.json.return_value = {'results': [{'id': 1, 'name': 'test'}]}
    mock_safe.return_value = mock_response
    name, info = find_namespace(name='test')
    assert name == 'test'
    assert info['id'] == 1

Test when using id:
def test_find_namespace_by_id(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    mock_response = mocker.Mock()
    mock_response.json.return_value = {'id': 2, 'name': 'test2'}
    mock_safe.return_value = mock_response
    name, info = find_namespace(id=2)
    assert name == 'test2'
    assert info['id'] == 2

Also test that it fetches owners via get_namespace_owners_details, which should be mocked.

For get_namespace_owners_details:
Test both old and new galaxy responses. For old, the response has 'results' and 'next_link'; for new, it's a list.

def test_get_owners_old_galaxy(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    first_response = mocker.Mock()
    first_response.json.return_value = {'results': ['owner1'], 'next_link': '/next'}
    second_response = mocker.Mock()
    second_response.json.return_value = {'results': ['owner2'], 'next_link': None}
    mock_safe.side_effect = [first_response, second_response]
    owners = get_namespace_owners_details('baseurl', 1)
    assert owners == ['owner1', 'owner2']

def test_get_owners_new_galaxy(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    mock_safe.return_value.json.return_value = ['owner1', 'owner2']
    owners = get_namespace_owners_details('baseurl', 1)
    assert owners == ['owner1', 'owner2']

Now for the iterators. These are generators, so tests need to check that they yield the correct items. For example, upstream_namespace_iterator:

def test_upstream_namespace_iterator(mocker):
    mock_safe = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.safe_fetch')
    mock_paginated = mocker.patch('galaxy_ng.app.utils.galaxy.paginated_results')
    mock_safe.return_value.json.return_value = {'count': 2, 'results': [{'id': 1}]}
    mock_paginated.return_value = []
    iterator = upstream_namespace_iterator()
    results = list(iterator)
    assert len(results) == 1
    # Check the items here

But this might get complex. Need to mock the safe_fetch and other dependencies properly.

Also, testing error conditions like 500 errors causing page increments.

This is a lot, but I need to structure each test with proper mocks and assertions. Also, ensure that all code paths are covered, including edge cases like empty responses, invalid URLs, etc.

I'll proceed to write the test file following the required template, including all the necessary imports and fixtures. Each function will have its own test cases, using pytest fixtures and mocks where needed.
